# Hi there, Mateus here! 👋

Hello! I am Mateus Galdino, Frond-end developer, former History teacher and IT enthusiast. Currently I work as a Front-end Dev focused on Javascript and currently learning React/Typescript, but I can/will/learn how to do many more things before settling down.

My hobbies include drawing and 3D Modeling. I know it is a bit unusual, but I consider myself a jack-of-all-trades.

If you want, let's connect and chat a little bit, I'm sure we will have of cool stuff to share!

See you around and let's code! 💪💻✌️
